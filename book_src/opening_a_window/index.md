# Opening A Window

If we wanna draw a triangle, we have to have some place to *put* a triangle.

Generally (but not always) this means showing it in a graphical window on the screen.

Because operating systems all support more than one drawing API,
and because many drawing APIs can be used with more than one operating system,
we're going to separate the lessons about opening a window from the lessons about using a particular drawing API.
